# An Implementation of the Minimax Algorithm in Tic-Tac-Toe

This C++ program implements a psuedointelligent algorithm that plays the game Tic-Tac-Toe.  

# Features

The program incorporates the Minimax alrogithm, which searches through a tree to identify the best possible move to be made at the given turn. 

Given that the grid is a simple 3x3, there is no need for further optimisation such as Alpha Beta Pruning, which would be more relevant for games like Quoridor, or if the grid were to be larger. Further experimentation could include using a larger Tic-Tac-Toe grid and observing the speed of the Minimax algorithm.
